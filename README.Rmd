# Overview 

This repository and this accompanying README is a set of tests for Google
Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020. 

These tests serve to show that I have the basic competencies required to make a 
GUI for the [gfpop package](https://github.com/vrunge/gfpop), which detects 
changepoints in univariate time series constrained to a graph structure.

# Easy Test

This test requires that I download the gfpop package, run the code in the vignette,
change the penalty parameter, and make a multi-panel ggplot that shows how the model
changes as the penalty parameter is varied. It specifies that there should be one
panel for each penalty parameter value.

# Medium Test

This test requires that I make a shiny app with an input that allows the user
to select the penalty parameter in that dataset, and shows a ggplot of the data and 
model with that penalty parameter.

_todo_

# Hard Test

For this test, I will write a D3.js data visualization in which the user can hover
over one displayed item and see it highlighted, along with other items.
