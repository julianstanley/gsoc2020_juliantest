# Overview 

This repository and this accompanying README is a set of tests for Google
Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020. 

These tests serve to show that I have the basic competencies required to make a 
GUI for the [gfpop package](https://github.com/vrunge/gfpop), which detects 
changepoints in univariate time series constrained to a graph structure.

# Easy Test

This test requires that I download the gfpop package, run the code in the vignette,
change the penalty parameter, and make a multi-panel ggplot that shows how the model
changes as the penalty parameter is varied. It specifies that there should be one
panel for each penalty parameter value.

```{r easy_test, message=F}
library(gfpop)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

# Simulate univariate gaussian data
n <- 1000
myData <- dataGenerator(n, c(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.8,1), c(1,2,1,3,1), sigma = 1)

# A function for computing the location of changepoints at a given penalty parameter
changepoint_locs <- function(penalty, data = myData) {
    myGraph <- graph(penalty = penalty, type = "updown")
    model <- gfpop(data = myData, mygraph = myGraph, type = "mean")
    num_changepoints <- length(model$changepoints)
    this_data <- data.frame(penalty = rep(penalty, num_changepoints), 
                            changepoint = model$changepoints,
                            changepoint_end = c(1, model$changepoints[1:num_changepoints-1]),
                            y = model$parameters)
    return(this_data)
}

# Generate penalities and data (note: no particular reason for the chosen 
# penalities. Just seemed to show the trend well.)
penalities <-  as.double(2^(1:9))
my_changepoints <- plyr::ldply(lapply(penalities, changepoint_locs), rbind)

# Show the results!
ggplot(my_changepoints) +
    facet_wrap(penalty ~ ., ncol = 3) +
    geom_point(data = data.frame(myData), aes(x = rep(1:1000, length(penalities)), y = myData)) +  
    geom_segment(aes(x = changepoint, xend = changepoint_end, y = y, yend = y), size = 1.5, col = "red") +
    xlab("X units (arbitrary)") +
    ylab("Univariate gaussian data (randomly generated)")
```

# Medium Test

This test requires that I make a shiny app with an input that allows the user
to select the penalty parameter in that dataset, and shows a ggplot of the data and 
model with that penalty parameter.

# Hard Test

For this test, I will write a D3.js data visualization in which the user can hover
over one displayed item and see it highlighted, along with other items.
